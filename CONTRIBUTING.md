## Coding Guidelines
Please follow these guidelines when contributing code to Lava:

* Include tests for any new code
* Follow the project's coding style (e.g. indentation, naming conventions)
* When writing the subject line for a pull request, **use imperative mode** (e.g. "Add feature X" instead of "Adding feature X")
* Make sure your code is well-documented and easy to understand
* If you're making a lot of changes, it's a good idea to break your work into smaller, self-contained pull requests
