## Lava open-source ðŸŒ‹ðŸ‘‹

WELCOME ðŸ˜» This is where we build the Lava Network, a trustless market for blockchain Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
Lava facilitates relay requests to any blockchain. 
The market runs on an appchain built using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) and Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus.

ðŸ§  We believe that blockchain data should be accurate. We believe access to that data should be scalable, private and uncensored. 
We achieve this by removing trust assumptions and pairing accountable node runners to applications peer-to-peer. 

ðŸ›  Lava is being built as a public good. Our Web3 API marketplace is not only open-source, but also public and permissionless, so anyone can join and consume or provide services.
